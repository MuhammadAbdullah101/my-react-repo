What is npm?
npm does not stands for node package manager(It is everything but node package manager)
npm manages the packages

package.json is configuration for npm


Bundler r is the most important package in package.json(Webpack, parcel,vite) it bundles our app so that we can ship it to production.


Episode 2 notes 
===============
There are two types of depencies 
Normal dependencies : used in Production (cmd :npm install)
devDepencies : used only for development purpose (Cmd :npm install -D)

package "^2.8.3": parcel will automatically update the version(minor upgrade)
package "~2.8.3": parcel will automatically update the version to major upgrade(major upgrade)


package-lock.json
Keeps record of every exact version of packages 

node-modules :It contains the code of all the packages the we installed

Transitive dependencies:  dependencies can depend on other depencies and those  other dependencies can be dependend on other dependencies.
that is why there are alot of dependencies/packages  in node-modules .

npx is used to execute the package e.g npx parcel index.html
