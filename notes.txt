What is npm?
npm does not stands for node package manager(It is everything but node package manager)
npm manages the packages

package.json is configuration for npm


Bundler r is the most important package in package.json(Webpack, parcel,vite) it bundles our app so that we can ship it to production.


Episode 2 notes 
===============
There are two types of depencies 
Normal dependencies : used in Production (cmd :npm install)
devDepencies : used only for development purpose (Cmd :npm install -D)

package "^2.8.3": parcel will automatically update the version(minor upgrade)
package "~2.8.3": parcel will automatically update the version to major upgrade(major upgrade)


package-lock.json
Keeps record of every exact version of packages 

node-modules :It contains the code of all the packages the we installed

Transitive dependencies:  dependencies can depend on other depencies and those  other dependencies can be dependend on other dependencies.
that is why there are alot of dependencies/packages  in node-modules .

npx is used to execute the package e.g npx parcel index.html 

Episode 3 notes  
===============
ReactDom.createRoot convert React.creatElement Object into actual html element

jSX: Syntax to createReactElement in easy way. (Html-like)
e.g React.createElement("h1", {}, "Hello world"); ==> <h1>Hello World </h1>
JSX (transpiled before it reached JS engin in browsers)
Browsers don't understand JSX (Babel converts JSX code to valid Pure JS code that browser understands)

Babel: Its is JS compiler AKA transpiler
      (converts Jsx to browser undertandable code)

React Component:
There are two type of components
1: class based components (Old way of writing React component) not used anymore
2: Functional Component (New  way of writing React component) 99.99% dev used 
    FunctionalComponent is just a JS fucntion which returns some piece of JSX

Episode 4 notes  
===============

config driven UI

we gave config(Data)  we get data for specific UI 
lets say showing offers on some products based on location/city etc

Keys in map() are very important for react to
render  items efficiently.
if we dont use key , react will re-render all the items 
for new item.

Keys play important role in performance & optimization

index as key are not recommended by React
because the order of items might change and for new Item 
it will agarin re-renders all the items
as react will consider it as like other items
